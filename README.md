# pidash

A dashboard for my Arch Linux-based Raspberry Pi home server.

I'm publishing this here mostly as a backup and as part of my "portfolio", so please don't expect it to be ready for use.

Should you want to use it anyway, here's a few pointers:
 * Written for Python 2.7
 * Requires `systemd`, uses `journalctl` and `systemctl`
 * You have to allow its user to run a few commands with `sudo`.
